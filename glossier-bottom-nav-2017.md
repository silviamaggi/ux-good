# Glossier’s bottom navigation

In 2017, Glossier abandoned the hamburger menu. 

> At first glance, \[Hamburger menus\] it’s a seemingly elegant solution. You can add an endless number of navigational elements and options into the side drawer while boasting a clutter-free, Marie Kondo’ed main navigation. Designers are happy. Business people asking for more links are happy, too.
> 
> Unfortunately, adding more and more links to the side navigation is the equivalent of stuffing things under the couch in an effort to clean up your apartment. It appears immaculate, but really, you’re sitting on top of a huge mess.
