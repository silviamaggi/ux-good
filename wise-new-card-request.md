My Wise debit card expired. I received a push notification and ordered a new one once I got on a train. 

## The flow

A quick and easy three-step process.

On screen: 

1. What you need to do next
2. Things you’ve done
3. Button to continue and enter the delivery address

Done. Your card is on its way. There’s the date of possible delivery and the fact that the card’s details are ready to use.
