# High-motion notice and best toggle use I’ve even seen

![Dialogue window asking if the user want to activate the reduced-motion preference, as the story contains high-motion animation](./assets/reduced-motion-toggle.jpeg)

The dialogue window shows care. I also like how the toggle to set the preference to ON or OFF has labels clearly indicating its status.

The text "Reduced-motion is off" makes it impossible to misunderstand. Toggles are not user-friendly components. It doesn’t matter how commonly used they are.
